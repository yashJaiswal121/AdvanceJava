--------INTRO AND THEORY:(Java67.com)------------------------

The main difference between trustStore vs keyStore is that 
trustStore (as the name suggest) is used to store certificates from trusted Certificate authorities(CA) which are used to verify certificate presented by Server in SSL Connection 
while keyStore is used to store the private key and own identity certificate which program should present to other parties (Server or client) to verify its identity. 


#Difference between KeyStore vs TrustStore in Java
In order to understand the difference between keyStore and trustStore you need to understand How SSL conversation happens between client and server 
because this is the starting point of confusion, many Java programmer doesn't pay attention whether they are implementing the server side of SSL connection 
or client-side of SSL Connection. 

One example is setting up SSL for tomcat on is server-side of SSL while setting up JDBC over SSL is the client-side of SSL connection.
If you are implementing SSL on Server side you need a KeyStore to store your server certificate and private key. 

Anytime a client will connect to the server, the server will present its certificate stored in KeyStore and the client will verify that certificate by comparing it with certificates
 stored on its trustStore. 


#DIFF POINTS
1.Keystore is used to store your credential (server or client) while truststore is used to store others' credentials (Certificates from CA).

2. Keystore is needed when you are setting up server-side on SSL, it is used to store server's identity certificate, which server will present to a client on the connection while trust store setup on client-side must contain to make the connection work. If your browser connects to any website over SSL it verifies the certificate presented by the server against its truststore.

3. Though I omitted this in the last section to reduce confusion you can have both keystore and truststore on the client and server-side if the client also needs to authenticate itself on the server. In this case, the client will store its private key and identify the certificate on the keystore and the server will authenticate the client against the certificate stored on the server's trust store.

6. When you install JDK or JRE on your machine, Java comes with its own truststore (collection of a certificate from well known CA like Verisign, GoDaddy, Thawte, etc. you can find this file inside

JAVA_HOME/JRE/Security/cacerts where JAVA_HOME is your JDK Installation directory.

7. keytool command (binary comes with JDK installation inside JAVA_HOME/bin) can be used to create and view both keyStore and trustStore.


That's all about the difference between truststore and keystore in Java.
Just remember one line keystore is used to store the server's own certificate 
while truststore is used to store the certificate of other parties issued by CA like Verisign or GoDaddy or even self-signed certificates.
