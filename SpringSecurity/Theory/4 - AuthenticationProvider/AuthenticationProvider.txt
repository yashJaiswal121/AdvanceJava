# The AuthenticationProvider has authenticate() method signature as:
Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication);

Here Authentication Object Passed in Param has only Username/Passwd/OTP etc INPUT from UI user. But the  Authentication Object returned from it has info if authentication was sucessful and other etc.


# The AuthenticationProvider has support() method signature as:
boolean supports(Authentication auth);
 It tells if the this AuthenticationProvider Implementation is appropiate for given Authentication object(auth here) ie if param Authentication object(auth here) has username/passwd/OTP etc what is expected by this  AuthenticationProvider Implementation. This can be checked by checking type of Authentication object.

Since the application can have multiple AuthenticationProvider Implementations, this support() is used to identify which of these implementation to use as per INPUT from UI user.
And this support() is used in ProviderManager.java/AuthenticationManager

#SEE DaoAuthenticationProvider.support(), which checks for Type of Authentication Object i.e works/return true for UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken Object.
#SIMILARLY SEE TestingAuthenticationProvider.support(), which also checks for Type of Authentication Object i.e works/return true for TestingAuthenticationToken Object.
