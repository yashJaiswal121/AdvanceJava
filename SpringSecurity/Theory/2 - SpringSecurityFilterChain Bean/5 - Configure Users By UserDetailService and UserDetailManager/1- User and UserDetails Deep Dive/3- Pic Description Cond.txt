# The Authentication Object(UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) and the UserDetail Object(User) , both store some common user info like username,password etc.
# UserDetail Object(User) have some extra details like isAccntExpired etc AND Authentication Object has extra info like isAuthenticated(which covers all conclusions of isAccntExpired etc variables in UserDeatil Object)

# The AuthenticationManager(ProviderManager) and Components/Filters before it in flow uses Authentication Object and not UserDetail Object in their code. So the AuthenicationProvider(DaoAuthenticationProvider.java) converts and returns the UserDetails Object to Authentication Object.

# Authentication Interface( whose Impl is UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) extends Principal interface of Java
